## Description
This is a simple RAILS superheroes API project for my week 2 phase 4 code challenge at Moringa School. It is a simple API that allows you to create, read, update and delete superheroes(heroes, powers). To get started, clone the repo and run the following commands:

```
& cd superheroes-API
& rails db:migrate db:seed
& rails s
```
You can try all the CRUD operations in the following routes:

```
& http://localhost:3000/heroes
& http://localhost:3000/powers
& http://localhost:3000/hero_powers
```
